   * <p>{openHoursString()}</p>
   * due to the fact that JSX will not render the boolean from isOpen()
   *
   * Remember even though we can't use an if/else (because it does not return a value) we can use the ternary operator instead as that returns it's true or false statement which is a safer way to do Conditional Rendering (in case it's a truey/falsey rather than true/false eg 0 or null)
